# APK-File-Automatic-Pentester-
This script is a shell script that performs a basic or advanced analysis of an APK file using several tools, such as apktool, jadx, MobSF, and JQ. The script checks if pip is installed and installs the required dependencies using pip. It then prompts the user to enter the path to the APK file and provides the user with options to choose between basic analysis and advanced analysis.

The basic analysis method includes unpacking the APK file, exporting the source code from the APK, analyzing the APK with MobSF, extracting the vulnerabilities from the report, and cleaning up. The advanced analysis method includes all of the basic analysis steps as well as extracting information about the app's network behavior and file system access.

The script uses colors to make the output more readable and uses if statements to check if each step completes successfully before proceeding to the next step.
